Bootstrap Landing Page

This is a landing page created for a company named Semadia. With the main focus being relaxation and calmness, the overall design of the page is of a minimalistic sense. Focusing on
calming colours and contrasting black text, the layout allows for the pleasant reading of the paragraphs. 

Technical Stack:
- Bootstrap 5
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- jQuery

The landing consists of:
- Navigation bar
- Home section

With additional assistance from CDN links as well as jQuery, I was able to add features within the project to make the landing page more responsive and suitable for different 
devices. 

Thank You.
